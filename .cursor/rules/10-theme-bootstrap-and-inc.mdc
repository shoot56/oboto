globs: functions.php, inc/**/*.php

- Keep global theme setup in `functions.php` (theme supports, global enqueues, global filters, and includes).
- Prefer adding new shared PHP logic under `inc/` and include it from `functions.php`.
- Register WordPress hooks (`add_action`, `add_filter`) close to the function/class definition, consistent with existing style.
- When changing routing/rewrites or request handling, ensure changes align with `./docs/01-architecture.md` and `./docs/06-versioning-and-evolution.md`.
