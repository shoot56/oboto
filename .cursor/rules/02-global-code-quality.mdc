description: Global quality constraints for this WordPress theme: English-only, DRY, safe input handling, and clear naming.
globs:

- All comments, inline docs, and any commit messages you suggest MUST be in English.
- Prefer reuse over duplication: check `./docs/03-reuse-catalog.md` before adding new helpers/blocks.
- Avoid magic numbers in new code: use named constants/config/options when a value is not self-evident.
- Use clear, descriptive names; avoid cryptic abbreviations.
- For request-driven code (e.g. AJAX handlers), sanitize inputs and escape output where appropriate (see `./docs/02-conventions.md`).
- Do not compile SCSS as part of your work in this repo.
