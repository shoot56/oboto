- Use `./docs/*.md` as primary context before making changes.
- Follow architecture boundaries from `./docs/01-architecture.md` (theme bootstrap → inc modules → blocks → templates/parts).
- Before creating anything “new”, check `./docs/03-reuse-catalog.md` and reuse existing blocks/modules where applicable.
- If `./docs` and code disagree, do not guess: mark **TODO: Clarify with tech lead** and propose the smallest safe change.
